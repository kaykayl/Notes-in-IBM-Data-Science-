All of my notes while taking online course "IBM Data Science" on edX

I'm taking several online courses and one of them is IBM Data Science on edX. I started on October 13,2021, I'm looking to finish the whole course within just 3 months even the course is expecting it to be finished within 1 year. So here I'll keep my notes that might help others so they can see all my practices within the course and how I will progress fast.
